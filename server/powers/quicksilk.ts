/**
 * Quicksilk — "Web Trap"
 *
 * After Quicksilk moves, it leaves a sticky silk web on the
 * space it departed. Enemies stepping on webs lose 2 SPD.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (move)
 * Effect: space_effect "web" on departed position, duration 3
 *
 * Design: Quicksilk is a speedster (HP 60, ATK 9, SPD 9).
 * Very fast with moderate ATK. Web Trap is area denial —
 * Quicksilk zooms around the board leaving sticky webs that
 * slow anyone who walks through them. Combined with Gustling's
 * Breeze Trail (similar space_effect), the board becomes a
 * minefield of movement modifiers. Quicksilk controls space
 * while Gustling controls air — two speedster styles.
