/**
 * Toxiblast — "Toxic Residue"
 *
 * After Toxiblast attacks, it leaves toxic residue on the
 * target's space — a poison space effect that lingers for
 * 3 turns. Enemies walking through or standing on it take
 * damage.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (attack)
 * Effect: space_effect "poison" on self's position, duration 3
 *
 * Design: Toxiblast is a glass cannon (HP 70, ATK 15, SPD 4).
 * Higher HP than most glass cannons — more of a durable
 * damage dealer. Toxic Residue adds area denial on top of
 * raw damage. Unlike Quicksilk (webs slow) or Skidmark
 * (scorch burns), poison is a lingering damage threat.
 * Attack → poison the space you're standing on → move away.
 * Battlefield control through contamination.
