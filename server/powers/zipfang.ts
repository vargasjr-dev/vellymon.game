/**
 * Zipfang — "Blood Rush"
 *
 * Zipfang is so recklessly fast it burns through its own
 * body — losing 2 HP at the start of every turn. A true
 * glass cannon: the highest speed, great attack, and a
 * ticking clock built into its own biology.
 *
 * Hook: onTurnStart
 * Effect: bonus_damage (self-damage) 2 HP on self
 *
 * Design: Zipfang is a speedster (HP 40, ATK 12, SPD 10).
 * TIED FASTEST in the entire game (SPD 10, with Joltmink).
 * Second-lowest HP (40, only Voidclaw is lower at 45).
 * Blood Rush makes it even more fragile — it wins by
 * ending fights fast before the clock runs out on itself.
 *
 * 64th and FINAL vellymon enrichment. ⚔️
