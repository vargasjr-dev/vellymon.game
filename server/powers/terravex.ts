/**
 * Terravex — "Bedrock Stance"
 *
 * When Terravex takes damage, it digs in — reducing its
 * speed by 1 but increasing its attack power by 2. The
 * more hits it takes, the slower and more devastating
 * it becomes. Reliable as bedrock.
 *
 * Hook: onDamaged
 * Effects: speed_mod -1, bonus_damage +2 to self
 *
 * Design: Terravex is balanced (HP 70, ATK 14, SPD 4).
 * Already the highest ATK among balanced vellymons. Each
 * hit trades mobility for raw power — a berserker that
 * roots itself deeper. After 2 hits: ATK effectively 18
 * (matching Pyroburst) but SPD 2. The opponent must
 * choose: ignore it and let it harvest, or hit it and
 * make it a monster. Classic risk/reward.
