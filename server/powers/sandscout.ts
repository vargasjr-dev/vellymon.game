/**
 * Sandscout — "Desert Sight"
 *
 * At the start of each turn, Sandscout's keen scouting gives
 * its team a tactical edge — harvesting costs 1 less energy.
 * The scout sees the best harvest spots before anyone else.
 *
 * Hook: onTurnStart
 * Effect: cost_mod -1 to self (cheaper harvests)
 *
 * Design: Sandscout is balanced (HP 80, ATK 10, SPD 6).
 * Well-rounded across all stats — the true generalist.
 * Desert Sight makes harvesting cheaper, accelerating the
 * energy economy. A quiet support-like balanced type that
 * enables accumulation strategies. Sees everything, reports
 * nothing — but the team benefits from the scout's intel.
