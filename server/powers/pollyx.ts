/**
 * Pollyx — "Pollen Cloud"
 *
 * At the end of each turn, Pollyx spreads pollen that slows
 * all active enemy vellymons by -1 SPD. Annoyingly persistent
 * debuff that blankets the entire enemy team.
 *
 * Hook: onTurnEnd
 * Effect: speed_mod -1 to each active enemy
 *
 * Design: Pollyx is a support (HP 68, ATK 6, SPD 8). Fast
 * but fragile with the lowest ATK among supports. Pollen Cloud
 * compensates by debuffing the entire enemy team's speed every
 * turn. Over 2-3 turns, even speedsters become sluggish. Pairs
 * perfectly with slow tanks like Plateor or Mosswall — slow
 * the enemy down so your bruisers can catch them.
