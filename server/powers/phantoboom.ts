/**
 * Phantoboom — "Detonation"
 *
 * When Phantoboom is knocked out, it detonates — dealing 8
 * bonus damage to the first active enemy vellymon. The
 * phantom materializes one final time to explode.
 *
 * Hook: onKnockout
 * Effect: bonus_damage 8 to first active enemy
 *
 * Design: Phantoboom is a glass cannon (HP 65, ATK 15, SPD 5).
 * High attack with moderate speed. Detonation makes it a
 * lose-lose for opponents — killing Phantoboom costs 8 HP to
 * an enemy. Combined with ATK 15 output while alive, the
 * total damage Phantoboom inflicts often exceeds its own HP.
 * Tanks especially hate this — they invest turns taking it
 * down only to eat phantom shrapnel.
