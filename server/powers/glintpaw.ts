/**
 * Glintpaw — "Flash Strike"
 *
 * Every 3rd attack deals +4 bonus damage. The paws charge
 * up with each strike and release a blinding flash.
 *
 * Hook: onBeforeCommand
 * Effect: bonus damage +4 on every 3rd attack
 *
 * Design: Glintpaw is balanced (HP 85, ATK 10, SPD 5). Solid
 * all-around stats with a rhythmic power spike. Players who
 * track the cycle can time big attacks for maximum impact.
 * Rewards consistent aggression over hit-and-run.
