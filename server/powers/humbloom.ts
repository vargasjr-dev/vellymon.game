/**
 * Humbloom — "Zen Harvest"
 *
 * When Humbloom harvests, it also heals the lowest-HP ally
 * for 3 HP. The hum resonates with teammates.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (harvest)
 * Effect: heal 3 HP to lowest-HP active ally
 *
 * Design: Humbloom is a support (HP 72, ATK 7, SPD 7).
 * Balanced stats with low attack. Zen Harvest turns the
 * economy action (harvesting for energy) into a dual-purpose
 * move — energy + healing. Teams with Humbloom can sustain
 * longer, making it a linchpin for Accumulation wins.
