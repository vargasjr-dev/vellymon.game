/**
 * Skidmark — "Friction Burn"
 *
 * After Skidmark moves, it leaves a scorch mark on the
 * departed space. Enemies on scorch marks take 2 damage
 * at the start of each turn.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (move)
 * Effect: space_effect "scorch" on departed position, duration 2
 *
 * Design: Skidmark is a speedster (HP 58, ATK 10, SPD 8).
 * Balanced attack for a speedster. Friction Burn is area
 * denial through damage (unlike Quicksilk's speed-reducing
 * webs). Scorch marks last 2 turns and threaten anyone
 * standing on them. Skidmark zooms around leaving a trail
 * of fire — the battlefield becomes increasingly dangerous
 * the longer it lives.
