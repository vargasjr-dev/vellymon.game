/**
 * Lumisprout — "Bioluminescence"
 *
 * At the start of each turn, Lumisprout heals all active
 * allies for 1 HP. A gentle passive glow that sustains the
 * whole team over time.
 *
 * Hook: onTurnStart
 * Effect: heal 1 HP to each active ally (including self)
 *
 * Design: Lumisprout is a support (HP 85, ATK 9, SPD 6).
 * Tanky for a support with the highest HP in its class.
 * Bioluminescence is subtle but powerful — 1 HP per ally
 * per turn adds up fast with 4 active vellymons (4 HP/turn
 * total team healing). The longer the game goes, the more
 * value Lumisprout provides. Kill it early or get outsustained.
