/**
 * Voidclaw — "Void Rend"
 *
 * After Voidclaw attacks, its void portals drain 2 energy
 * from the opponent team. Each strike tears through
 * dimensions, hitting both health and economy.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (attack)
 * Effect: energy -2 to enemy team
 *
 * Design: Voidclaw is a glass cannon (HP 37, ATK 17, SPD 5).
 * Among the lowest HP in the game combined with very high ATK.
 * Void Rend drains 2 energy per attack — double Shrednova's drain.
 * A single Voidclaw attack is devastating: 17 damage + 2 energy loss.
 * But at 37 HP, one good hit ends it. High risk, high reward.
