/**
 * Wrecktor — "Wrecking Ball"
 *
 * After Wrecktor attacks, the sheer force knocks the
 * target back — creating a block on the attacked space.
 * Pure wrecking: damage + terrain disruption.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (attack)
 * Effect: block on self's position
 *
 * Design: Wrecktor is a glass cannon (HP 58, ATK 16, SPD 4).
 * Similar concept to Thornlash (attack → block), but
 * Wrecktor has higher ATK (16 vs 17) and more HP (58 vs 55).
 * Less extreme than Thornlash — slightly more durable,
 * slightly less damage. "Built to wreck" — every attack
 * leaves destruction in its wake, reshaping the board.
 * The simplest power for the simplest philosophy: wreck.
