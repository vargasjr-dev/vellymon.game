/**
 * Flashfin — "Blinding Dash"
 *
 * After Flashfin attacks, the target loses 2 SPD for the next
 * turn. The flash from its acceleration leaves opponents dazed.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand
 * Effect: speed_mod -2 on the attack target
 *
 * Design: Flashfin is a speedster (HP 62, ATK 8, SPD 9). Fragile
 * but blindingly fast. Blinding Dash compounds its speed advantage
 * by slowing targets — hit and run, then hit again before they
 * recover. The ultimate skirmisher.
