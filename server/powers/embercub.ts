/**
 * Embercub — "Inner Fire"
 *
 * When Embercub drops below 50% HP, it gains +3 ATK from sheer
 * grit. A warm little cub that fights hardest when cornered.
 *
 * Hook: onDamaged
 * Effect: bonus_damage is checked via onTurnStart for the buff,
 *   but the trigger is being below half HP — a comeback mechanic.
 *
 * Design: Embercub is balanced (HP 72, ATK 13, SPD 4). Below 36 HP
 * it effectively becomes ATK 16, turning it into a glass cannon
 * that rewards risky positioning. Pairs well with healers.
