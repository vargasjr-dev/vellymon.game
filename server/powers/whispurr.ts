/**
 * Whispurr — "Calming Purr"
 *
 * At the start of each turn, Whispurr's soothing frequency
 * calms one ally — reducing their next action cost by 1.
 * The purr makes the whole team more efficient.
 *
 * Hook: onTurnStart
 * Effect: cost_mod -1 on a random active non-KO ally
 *
 * Design: Whispurr is a support (HP 75, ATK 6, SPD 7).
 * Unlike Starveil (self cost reduction) or Nectarb (team
 * energy gen), Whispurr gives cost reduction to ALLIES.
 * A team buffer that makes everyone around it cheaper
 * to operate. Fast for a support (SPD 7) — acts early
 * to set up the team's turn.
