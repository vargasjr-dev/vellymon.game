/**
 * Magmorus — "Meltdown"
 *
 * When Magmorus attacks, it also takes 3 self-damage from its
 * own molten core destabilizing. The thin rocky shell cracks
 * with every strike.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (attack)
 * Effect: bonus_damage 3 to self
 *
 * Design: Magmorus is THE ultimate glass cannon (HP 48, ATK 19,
 * SPD 4). Highest attack stat in the entire game but lowest HP
 * among glass cannons and brutally slow. Meltdown adds a
 * self-destruct timer — each attack costs 3 HP, meaning
 * Magmorus can attack roughly 16 times before KO'ing itself.
 * In practice, 2-3 devastating hits before it melts down.
 * Pure burst damage that demands precise positioning.
