/**
 * Shrednova — "Reality Shred"
 *
 * When Shrednova attacks, the reality-shredding claws also
 * drain 1 energy from the opponent. Each strike tears at
 * both health and the enemy's energy economy.
 *
 * Hook: onAfterCommand (attack)
 * Effect: energy -1 to enemy team
 *
 * Design: Shrednova is a glass cannon (HP 50, ATK 18, SPD 5).
 * Tied with Pyroburst for 2nd-highest ATK, but Shrednova has
 * no self-damage — instead it drains enemy energy. Terrifying
 * offensive pressure: high damage + economy disruption. The
 * catch is HP 50 (among the lowest) — one focused attack and
 * Shrednova shatters. Glass-cannon purity.
