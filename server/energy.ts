/**
 * Unified energy system for vellymon matches.
 *
 * Energy is a team-wide pool — shared across all vellymons.
 * - Attacks spend energy from the pool (cost varies per attack)
 * - Harvesting generates energy (+1 base rate per action, some spaces give more)
 * - At 0 energy, only Move and Harvest are available (no attacks)
 * - Energy is both the Accumulation win condition AND the attack resource
 *
 * This creates the core tension: every attack is a direct tradeoff against
 * winning via Accumulation, and every harvest is a turn not attacking.
