            Your roster has 8 vellymons — 4 active, 4 on the bench. Here are
            some roles to consider when building your team:
          </p>

          <RoleCard
            name="The Anchor"
            desc="A high-HP vellymon that holds a key position (usually an occupation point). Hard to kill, keeps your board presence stable."

          <RoleCard
            name="The Striker"
            desc="A high-ATK vellymon that threatens knockouts. Your main source of Elimination pressure."
            example="Blastova (ATK 20, HP 45) — hits like a supernova, but burns bright and dies fast."
          />
          <RoleCard
            name="The Scout"
            desc="A fast vellymon that acts first each turn. Controls tempo: grabs harvest nodes, reaches zones early, picks off weakened targets."
            example="Blinkatt (SPD 10, ATK 11) — phases in, strikes, phases out."
          />
          <RoleCard
            name="The Harvester"
            desc="A vellymon dedicated to energy generation. Usually mid-speed with decent HP to survive while farming."
            example="Cloudpuff (HP 78, SPD 7) — floats around harvesting without a care."

        <Section title="Energy Management">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Energy is the most important resource in the game. Every attack
            costs energy. Running dry means you can only Move and Harvest —
            no fighting back.

            <Principle
              title="Harvest with purpose"
              desc="Spending a turn to Harvest isn't wasted — it's investment. A vellymon harvesting is a vellymon funding 2-4 more attacks for your team."

              title="Track your opponent's energy"

              title="Range matters"
              desc="Range 1 attacks (Poke, Strike, Slam, Nuke) only hit adjacent spaces. Range 2 attacks (Snipe, Lob, Chip) can hit from safety. Use ranged attackers to pressure without exposing them."

            <Principle
              title="Don't clump"
              desc="If all your vellymons are on adjacent spaces, area effects and special powers that target positions become devastating."
            />
            <Principle
              title="Block spawn points"
              desc="When you KO an opponent's vellymon, their replacement enters at a spawn point. If you're standing on it, you control when and how they can re-enter."
